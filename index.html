      <!-- ABOUT  -->
        <div id ="about">
        <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>French's Asylum Props-n-Stuff was established in 1985 when Ed's drama teacher said, "We need an old phone for this scene." and Ed replied, "I have one of those."</p>
            <p>"Do you have a doctor's bag?"</p>
            <p>"Yep. Oh, and I have some 'tools' for the villain, poison bottles for the Aunts, a fancy 'Elderberry Wine' bottle and the stemware to go with it. And a bear-trap..." He was credited as "Ed's Prop Shop" for that show. The name "French's Asylum" didn't come along until much later. But that's another story for another time.</p>
            <p>Ed learned his abilities for building odd props from his father's talent for making the strange things for the local Junior Theatre, dad made the bear-trap. The Frenchs are a family of collectors, dating back to the early 1900s whin Ed's grandpa first said, "Don't throw that away, we may need it some day..." Which has become somewhat of a Family Motto.</p>
            <p>It can be truly said, "If we don't have it, we know someone who does. If we don't know anyone, we know where to find it. If we can't find it, we can make it."</p>
